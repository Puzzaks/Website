# Twitch streaming

I have most of my experience exactly with Twitch and Telegram, I was streaming for 108 days straight, and gathered some statistics day by day (check out [spreadsheet with statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fyD1oLGG6WDWtJLUnQ8zLQd3p_AhQxuw61aMDnqPGg8)).

Twitch is most friendly to streamer platform (no surprise here, it's the platform made solely for streaming), and it is quite easy to set up your stream.

You can read how to stream with RTMP onto Twitch [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq#FAQ). But that's quite an easy task, just use list of [ingest endpoints](https://stream.twitch.tv/ingests/) to determine best one for you (in my case it was Frankfurt) and just use your stream key as shown below:

```
rtmp://fra05.contribute.live-video.net/app/{stream_key}
```

## Telegram streaming

Telegram stays the fastest and easiest way to test your stream, as well as streaming to channels appeared to me as useful.

You can see how to set up Telegram stream [here](#streaming-ffmpeg), and that's how it was:
